             <p> Kiernan Jarryd Forbes (born 28 January 1988) professionally known as AKA, was a South African award-winning rapper, producer 
                record producer and businessman. Born in Cape Town and raised in Johannesburg, Forbes gained his stardom after releasing 
                his single "Victory Lap" from his debut studio album, Altar Ego (2011). He was one of the most popular South African musicians 
                of his era and the greatest selling South African hip hop artist of all-time.
                Forbes continued his success by releasing studio albums namely; Levels (2014), Be Careful What You Wish For which was a collaborative 
                album he did with Anatii, Touch My Blood (2018), Bhovamania (2020) and his final album Mass Country (2023) which was released after his passing and 
                reached gold within a month after its release. </p>
               <p> He was quite an entertainer! He had been featured in April 2018 as a special guest on WWE Live events, which were held in Johannesburg and Cape Town. 
                We also got to see the rapper showcase in unique features such as 'Roast of AKA'on comedy central.
                His career did not start out as a solo artist. He hails from a group called ENTITY, comprised of childhood friends Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, and Nhlanhla Makenna. 
                Entity were able to release a studio album titled Royal School of Hip Hop (2005). </p>
                <p>AKA will not only be remembered for his arts and talents. He was also known for his sentimental side - as a Father
                to his beautiful daughter Kairo whom he had with his ex-lover DJ Zinhle. The rapper was also very close to his family and had recently
                tried 'love' again with a South African musician Nadia Nakai, their love was a bliss to watch from a distance and it 
                portrayed the much affectionate side of the late <strong>SUPERMEGA</strong>.</p>

                Lastly, we will never let his famous phrase die out....'This is Super Vision and Control'! In his very own words from his lyrics, we say:
                Long live, Supermega, Long live - long live to his legacy!
